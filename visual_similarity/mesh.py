    This class can be seen as a representation of a triangular mesh. It is also 
    (or more so) a holder two numpy arrays: 1. vertices, or verts, a list of 
    x,y,z coordinates in floats, and 2. faces, a list of verts indices in int32. 
    verts has shape = (V,3), where V is the total number of vertices; faces 
    has shape = (F,3), where F is the total number of faces in the mesh. 
    They can provide many useful mathematical insights and can easily be used
    to visualize the mesh. 
    
    Each Mesh instance should be treated like separate objects. That is, two
    Mesh objects should not share references to same verts and/or faces arrays. 
    A class method copy(Mesh) is provided if you need to duplicate or backup
    a mesh. 
    
    Some simple operations are included in the class. You can do basic 
    transformations like rotation and translation by calling each respective 
    functions; as a result, verts will be linearly modified, thus the mesh is 
    "transformed". Advanced and potentially non reversible operations are not 
    implemented.
